Gnome-Pie
======

⚠️ _At this point, I will only provide very basic support for Gnome-Pie. If you are on a GNOME Shell based distro, you may want to try my successor project, [**Fly-Pie**](https://github.com/Schneegans/Fly-Pie). You can read some [background information here](http://schneegans.github.io/news/2020/08/13/flypie)._

**Gnome-Pie** is a circular application launcher for Linux. It is made of several pies, each consisting of multiple slices. The user presses a key stroke which opens the desired pie. By activating one of its slices, applications may be launched, key presses may be simulated or files can be opened.

Feel free to visit its **homepage** at http://simmesimme.github.io/gnome-pie.html

## Installing from a PPA!

There is a PPA with a recent version of Gnome-Pie. If you simply want to test it, it's very easy to install:

~~~~
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:simonschneegans/testing
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gnome-pie
~~~~

## Compiling and installing from source & Usage

Please refer to the [guides on Gnome-Pie's homepage](http://simmesimme.github.io/gnome-pie.html)!

## Support my work!

I really like working on Gnome-Pie — and you can help improving it! There are multiple ways:

### Translate Gnome-Pie!

This is really easy: [There is an how-to available](http://simmesimme.github.io/lessons/2015/08/07/translate-gnome-pie/)!

### Donate!

If you can’t afford the time to do the stuff mentioned above, but still want to help — you can help improving this software by buying some drinks for a poor student ;) ! You can [do this with the Flattr](http://flattr.com/thing/468485/Gnome-Pie) or by [donating via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=X65SUVC4ZTQSC). If you happen to dislike PayPal, send a mail to code@simonschneegans.de and we can chat about this!
