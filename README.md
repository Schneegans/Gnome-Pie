Gnome-Pie
======

Feel free to visit its **homepage** at http://schneegans.github.io/gnome-pie.html

**Gnome-Pie** is a circular application launcher for Linux. It is made of several pies, each consisting of multiple slices. The user presses a key stroke which opens the desired pie. By activating one of its slices, applications may be launched, key presses may be simulated or files can be opened.


## Installing from a PPA!

sudo apt-get install gnome-pie
~~~~

## Compiling and installing from source & Usage

## Support my work!

I really like working on Gnome-Pie — and you can help improving it! There are multiple ways:

### Translate Gnome-Pie!

This is really easy: [There is an how-to available](http://schneegans.github.io/news/2015/08/07/translate-gnome-pie)!

### Donate!

If you can’t afford the time to do the stuff mentioned above, but still want to help — you can help improving this software by buying some drinks for a poor student ;) ! You can [do this with the Flattr](http://flattr.com/thing/468485/Gnome-Pie) or by [donating via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=X65SUVC4ZTQSC). If you happen to dislike PayPal, send a mail to code@simonschneegans.de and we can chat about this!
